TODO: explanation of game flow

### Turn Structure

#### 1. Add a card to your hand
On a player's turn they must first add a card to their hand.
They do this in one of two ways:

1. Pick up the top card of their own discard pile.
2. Choose another stack of cards - either another player's discard pile or the deck - and draw 2 cards[^1]. Select one to add to your hand and discard the other to the top of your discard pile.

[^1]: If the chosen stack has only 1 card, then add that card to your hand. You may not choose an empty pile.

#### 2. Optionally play card(s) to a set
Before ending your turn, you may choose to play any card(s) from your hand to a face-up set in front of you.
**Sets** are cards of the same *type* - **Toys**, **Clothes**, or **Keepsakes**. Each type of *set* has an associated **Action**.

If you choose to play any card(s) to a set, then you immediately take the *action* associated with that type and size of set. The available actions are explained in the [Actions](##Actions) section.

#### 3. Optionally declare "Last Turn"
If you have TODO: MINIMAL AMOUNT OF POINTS you may choose to declare **"Last Turn"**. If you do so, then you must lay down and score your hand. Your opponents each have one more turn at the end of which they will also lay down and score their hand.

The points you earn from your score are determined by who called *Last Turn* and who had the highest scoring hand. Scoring is explained in the [Scoring](##Scoring) section.

## Actions
